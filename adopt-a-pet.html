      <p>You have found your one-stop shop for all things adoptions at <spna class="animal">Animal Shelter</span>. On this page you will find helpful information regarding what to expect when visiting the shelter and important resources for after you have adopted your new friend.</p>

      <p>Due to the high volume of calls, we are unable to provide specific animal information over the phone. Please look at each individual animal profile and come to the shelter to learn more. The best place to view the most up-to-date information is on the our website. Third party sites like petfinder.com and adopt-a-pet.com are great resources, but sometimes have outdated information regarding our pets.</p>

      <p><span class="animal">Animalshelter<span> is a private, nonprofit organization that relies on individual donations, grants and our own fundraising to operate. We do not receive any federal, state or government funding.</p>

      <p>Adoption fees help offset some of the costs associated with providing for the animals in our care – this includes housing, food, medical care, enrichment, behavior modification and more. We use variable pricing and the adoption fee for each animal is dependent on many factors including age, breed and health of the individual animal.</p>

      <p>Adoption fees range from $55-$600 for dogs and $15 to $200 for cats. The adoption fee for each animal is included in their animal profile. You can view the adoption fee for a specific animal by clicking on their profile.</p>
